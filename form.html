      <h2>Philosophy of the Pathfinder Ministry</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of having a Pathfinder Club is to lead its membership into a
        growing, redemptive relationship with Christ, and to build its
        membership into responsible, mature individuals in active selfless
        service.
      </p>
      <p>
        All pathfinder leaders are Christians, working hand in hand with
        parents, teachers, and pastors providing optimum opportunities for
        Christian development. The Pathfinder Club is an extension of the home,
        school and church. It is an experimental laboratory where growth and
        learning flourish.
      </p>
      <p>
        The membership involves youth in grades 5 – 10 (age 10 – 15) who have a
        desire for group activities ranging from community and world mission
        projects to nature, outdoor and camping activities, Annual BC Camporee,
        AY/Pathfinder class curriculum and AY Honors. Above all, Pathfinders
        give youth an environment in which to actively expand their personal
        experience with Christ.
      </p>
      <h2>Philosophy of Adventurer Ministry</h2>
      <p>
        The Adventurer Club is a Seventh-day Adventist Church-sponsored ministry
        to children aged 6 to 9 years old. There are also the Little Lamb and
        Eager Beaver segments for children aged 4 and 5, respectively. Around
        the world we have nearly 700,000 enrolled children in the Adventurer
        Ministry. This Ministry was created to assist parents in their important
        responsibilities as a child’s primary teachers and evangelizers. The
        program aims to strengthen the parent/child relationship and further the
        child’s development in spiritual, physical, mental and social areas. In
        this way the church, home and school can work together with the parent
        to develop a mature, happy child.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Church’s greatest resource is our children; therefore, it is
        imperative that as a church we meet the challenge to provide a ministry
        for our children during their early formative years. We want right
        habits, thoughts, motives, dispositions and attitudes to be established.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wise man wrote, “Bring up a child in the way he should go, and when
        he is old he will not turn from it.” (Proverbs 22:6). This is more than
        a cliché – it is a Bible principle which assures parents that the
        lessons learned in childhood will last a lifetime. Following the Lord
        will however, depend on the child’s choices. The Adventurer Ministry
        assists parents in guiding children to Christ.
      </p>
      <h2>Philosophy of Master Guide Ministry</h2>
      <p>
        The Seventh-day Adventist Church is committed to training youth and
        young adults for leadership and service to God and humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as God has used young people to pioneer the Adventist Church, He
        continually uses youth and young adults in this present generation to
        fulfill the mission of the Church. One of the most effective ways to
        cultivate their leadership potential is through the Master Guide Club
        ministry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Master Guide Club provides a balanced approach to the development of
        the spiritual, mental, physical, and social aspects of life. Its
        philosophy is based on the premise that young people, with the right
        training, will contribute to the finishing of God’s work. When young
        people are given the opportunity to take leadership roles, to be
        actively involved in discipling those in Adventurer Club, Pathfinder
        Club, Youth Ministries, and church ministries, and to take part in
        community service endeavors, they will be able to take ownership of the
        mission of the Church and gain life-changing experiences that will
        inspire their leadership and ministry.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the Master Guide Club exists to disciple children, youth,
        and young adults in conjunction with the Great Commission (Matt.
        28:19–20). With love as the distinguishing mark of a true disciple of
        Christ (John 13:35), the Master Guide Club will offer a friendly
        environment where everyone is loved, trusted, and supported, and
        meaningful relationships are forged. It is also a place where candidates
        will grow together spiritually and learn to work together using their
        God-given talents and spiritual gifts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Master Guide Club exists primarily for Adventurer Club, Pathfinder
        Club, Youth Ministries, and church ministries.
      </p>
